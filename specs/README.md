# Test Specifications (Specs)

This directory contains human-readable test plans used by Playwright Test Agents.

## Purpose

Specs are structured plans describing test scenarios that can be:
1. Created manually by QA engineers
2. Generated by the **Planner Agent** from app exploration
3. Transformed into executable tests by the **Generator Agent**

## Spec Format

Each spec file follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Test Plan

## Application Overview
Brief description of the feature and its context.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. [Scenario Name]
**Seed:** tests/seed.spec.ts

#### Steps:
1. First action
2. Second action
3. Third action

**Expected Results:**
- Expected outcome 1
- Expected outcome 2
```

## Key Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Seed** | Reference to the seed test file that sets up the environment |
| **Steps** | Sequential actions to perform in the test |
| **Expected Results** | Assertions to verify after completing steps |

## Using Specs with Agents

### With Planner Agent
```
@planner create a test plan for [feature] and save to specs/[feature].md
```

### With Generator Agent
```
@generator create tests from specs/[feature].md
```

## Existing Specs

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [checkout-flow.md](checkout-flow.md) | E-commerce checkout flow scenarios |
| [e2e-order-flow.md](e2e-order-flow.md) | Complete E2E flow from login to order placement |

## Best Practices

1. **One feature per spec** - Keep specs focused on a single feature
2. **Clear steps** - Write steps that can be mapped to Playwright actions
3. **Specific assertions** - Define concrete expected results
4. **Reference seed test** - Always specify which seed test to use
5. **Follow naming convention** - Use kebab-case for spec file names
